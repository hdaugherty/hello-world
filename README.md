A place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.

I am a 27 year old from Ohio. I am new to programming and GitHub and trying to get the most out of my experience. I took a semeester in college of Python and have been hooked ever since. I'm still trying to master the language and learn everything I can in the meantime.
