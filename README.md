A place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.

I am Holden still pretty fresh into programming, python and GitHub and trying to get the most out of my experience. I took a semester in college of Python and have been hooked ever since. I'm still trying to master the language and learn everything I can in the meantime.I've met some great people along the way and having a fun time doing it.
